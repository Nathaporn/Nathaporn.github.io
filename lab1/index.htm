<p>A <strong>raven</strong> is one of several larger-bodied species of the genus Corvus. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus.</p>
<p>There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens. In Europe, the word "crow" is used to refer to the carrion crow or the hooded crow, while in North America it is used for the American crow, fish crow, or the northwestern crow.</p>
<p>The largest raven species are the <b>common raven</b> and the <b>thick-billed raven</b>.</p>
